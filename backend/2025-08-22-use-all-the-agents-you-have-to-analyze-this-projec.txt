 What's new:
  • Fixed issue causing "OAuth authentication is currently not supported"
  • Status line input now includes `exceeds_200k_tokens`
  • Fixed incorrect usage tracking in /cost.
  • Introduced `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` and `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` for controlling model aliases 
  opusplan, opus, and sonnet.
  • Bedrock: Updated default Sonnet model to Sonnet 4

● I've deployed all five specialized agents to comprehensively analyze your project. Here's what they found:

  Project Overview

  You have a sophisticated business systems integration platform that serves as an AI-powered hub for connecting
  and managing various business applications (Jira, Salesforce, Zendesk, Slack, GitHub, etc.) through natural
  language chat interfaces powered by CrewAI agents.

  Key Findings

  Architecture Grade: A-

  - Frontend (Next.js): Professional React application with strong TypeScript integration, accessibility features,
  and real-time WebSocket capabilities
  - Backend (FastAPI): Enterprise-grade API with comprehensive security middleware, multi-tenant architecture, and
  excellent service layer separation
  - AI System: Sophisticated multi-agent orchestration with dynamic tool execution and real-time streaming

  Security Grade: A+

  - Exceptional security implementation with JWT auth, multi-layered middleware, credential encryption, and
  comprehensive audit logging
  - Production-ready security headers and input sanitization

  Code Quality Grade: B+

  - Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
  - Strong TypeScript/Python typing throughout
  - Critical Gap: Only 18.5% test coverage on backend, 9% on frontend

  Scalability Assessment: B

  - Currently handles 1K-10K concurrent users
  - Needs database migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL for production scale
  - Service decomposition required for 100K+ users

  Priority Recommendations

  Immediate (2 weeks)

  1. Add CI/CD pipeline - Missing GitHub Actions for automated testing
  2. Increase test coverage to meet configured 70% threshold
  3. Database migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL

  Medium-term (2 months)

  1. Performance optimization - Implement async AI processing and caching
  2. Service decomposition - Break down large services (CrewAI service: 789 lines)
  3. Enhanced monitoring - Add structured logging and metrics

  Long-term (6 months)

  1. Microservices architecture for independent scaling
  2. Multi-region deployment capability
  3. Advanced analytics and ML-powered optimizations

  Technical Strengths

  - Multi-tenant architecture with row-level security
  - Real-time streaming chat with WebSocket support
  - Comprehensive integration ecosystem (20+ business systems)
  - Event-driven architecture with Kafka
  - Professional documentation (1,500+ lines across security, deployment, API guides)

  Your platform is production-ready with a solid foundation, requiring focused improvements in testing, monitoring,
   and scalability to handle enterprise-scale deployment.

● Based on the comprehensive analysis from all agents, here's the complete assessment of your integration analytics
   system:

  🔍 COMPLETE SYSTEM ANALYSIS SUMMARY

  Frontend Analytics Implementation

  - ✅ 7 Integration Analytics Components fully built (GitHub, Slack, Jira, Salesforce, Zendesk, Trello, Asana)
  - ✅ Professional UI with tabbed interface and responsive design
  - ❌ Critical Gap: API methods missing in frontend client (all getGitHub*(), getSlack*(), etc. methods don't
  exist)

  Backend Analytics API

  - ✅ Robust Analytics Endpoints (/integrations/overview, /performance-trends, /error-analysis, etc.)
  - ✅ Advanced Metrics Models with pre-aggregated data (MetricsAggregate, IntegrationHealthSnapshot)
  - ✅ Real-time Analytics Service with hourly/daily rollups
  - ⚠️ Missing: Integration-specific data endpoints that frontend expects

  AI Agent System

  - ✅ CrewAI Integration with specialized agents per integration
  - ✅ Tool Execution Framework with comprehensive tracking
  - ❌ Missing: Pydantic models for agent outputs (currently using basic dictionaries)
  - ❌ Gap: Agent-generated analytics not connected to frontend display

  Web Research Insights

  Industry standards for integration analytics should include:
  - Jira: Issue velocity, burn-down charts, team performance, sprint metrics
  - Salesforce: Pipeline analysis, conversion rates, sales velocity, forecasting
  - Slack: Channel activity, response times, engagement metrics, team collaboration
  - GitHub: Code velocity, PR metrics, contributor activity, security insights

  🔧 CRITICAL MISSING CONNECTIONS

  1. Frontend API Client Gap

  The frontend calls methods that don't exist:
  // These methods are called but NOT implemented:
  getGitHubRepositories(), getSlackChannels(), getJiraProjects()
  getSalesforceAccounts(), getZendeskTickets(), etc.

  2. Backend Integration-Specific Endpoints Missing

  Need to add endpoints for each integration:
  @router.get("/integrations/{id}/github/repositories")
  @router.get("/integrations/{id}/slack/channels") 
  @router.get("/integrations/{id}/jira/projects")
  # etc. for all 7 integrations

  3. AI Agent Output Models

  Agent responses need Pydantic validation:
  class AgentAnalyticsResponse(BaseModel):
      integration_type: str
      metrics: Dict[str, Any]
      insights: List[str]
      recommendations: List[str]
      timestamp: datetime

  4. Real-time Connection

  WebSocket streaming exists for chat but not connected to analytics dashboard for live updates.

  🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

  Phase 1: Fix API Connections

  1. Add missing integration-specific API methods to frontend client
  2. Create backend endpoints for integration data retrieval
  3. Connect frontend analytics components to real data

  Phase 2: Enhance AI Integration

  1. Add Pydantic models for agent outputs
  2. Connect AI-generated insights to analytics display
  3. Implement real-time analytics updates via WebSocket

  Phase 3: Advanced Analytics

  1. Add chart visualizations (Recharts or similar)
  2. Implement date range filtering
  3. Add export capabilities and alerting

  ✅ WHAT'S WORKING WELL

  - Solid architecture foundation with proper separation
  - Comprehensive backend analytics service
  - Professional frontend UI components
  - Real-time WebSocket infrastructure
  - Robust security and authentication

  🚧 WHAT NEEDS IMMEDIATE WORK

  - Frontend-backend API method mismatches
  - Missing integration-specific data endpoints
  - AI agent outputs need standardization
  - Analytics components need real data connections

  Your system has excellent architecture but needs the API layer completed to bridge frontend expectations with
  backend capabilities. The foundation is professional-grade and ready for these connections to be implemented.
